Bonus - swarm with compose 


  --step-7

	Create a directory newnet-comp

Create docker-compose.yml
===========================
version: '3'
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "0.50"
          memory: "50M"
        reservations:
          cpus: "0.25"
          memory: "20M"
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 6


   --step-8

	#Prior deployment , you need to ensure you are in Leader machine 
	docker-machine env mymach1
	(run the last command)
	docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml mydckswarmimg

   --step-9
   docker ps -a 
	(Do you see any ?)

	docker stack ps mydckswarmimg
	To access these containers - you can visit the containers by docker exec -it and check for usage.

   --step-10

	#Now , Lets shut down one machine down and see how distribution happen

	docker-machine ssh myv "docker swarm leave --force"

	docker stack ps mydckswarmimg
	# Refer the column of current state and 
	# Do you see error description saying no image in Redis .. The recommendation is to have the image in each of the docker-machine so that it can run. Just pull the respective images in the docker-machine.

	docker-machine ssh mymach2 "docker swarm leave --force"

   --step-11

	docker stack rm mydckswarmimg
	docker stack ls
	docker network prune

	docker-machine env default
